	<br><br><p>C. V. Raman College of Engineering, Bhubaneswar, also called CVRCE, is an Autonomous engineering and management institution in the Capital City of Odisha, which was established in 1997 under C.V. Raman Group of Institutions. The institute is accredited by NBA. The college certifies to ISO 9001:2000.[1]

The institute is rated as "A" Grade Engineering college by NAAC[2] and is affiliated to Biju Patnaik University of Technology. The college is also conferred with autonomous status, first of its kind in the state of Odisha by UGC. CVRCE is placed at 74th Position ,among Engineering Institutes including NITs and IITs, in an all India Ranking carried out by National Institutional Ranking Framework (NIRF), an initiative of Ministry of Human Resources and Development, Government of India.It offers a three-year postgraduate degree program in Master of Computer Applications, two year master's degree in MBA and three years B.Tech degree for diploma holders under lateral entry scheme with the approval of AICTE New Delhi, recognized by Govt.of Odisha and affiliated under Biju Patnaik University of Technology. It also offers a 3-year diploma in the following disciplines: Electrical engineering, Civil engineering, Mechanical engineering, Electronics & Telecommunication engineering and Computer science engineering. Ranjita institute of hotel management is a sister concern of CVRCE.Sir Chandrasekhara Venkata Raman[2] (7 November 1888 – 21 November 1970) was an Indian physicist born in the former Madras Province in India presently called as Tamil Nadu, who carried out ground-breaking work in the field of light scattering, which earned him the 1930 Nobel Prize for Physics. He discovered that when light traverses a transparent material, some of the deflected light changes in wavelength. This phenomenon, subsequently known as Raman scattering, results from the Raman effect.[3] In 1954, India honoured him with its highest civilian award, the Bharat Ratna.[4][5]

Raman's father initially taught in a school in Thiruvanaikaval, became a lecturer of mathematics and physics in Mrs. A.V. Narasimha Rao College, Visakhapatnam (then Vishakapatnam) in the Indian state of Andhra Pradesh, and later joined Presidency College in Madras (now Chennai)</p>

	 <p>The College of Management Academic Studies, a college located in the city of Rishon LeZion Israel, is the largest college in Israel. Founded in 1978, COMAS is the first non-subsidized, not-for-profit academic institution in Israel to be recognized and certified by the Council for Higher Education in Israel. It offers bachelor's and master's degrees in business administration, law, media, economics, organizational development and consulting, computer science, behavioral sciences, family studies and interior design. The college places an emphasis on social awareness and responsibility, with both students and faculty taking part in community.The College of Management - Academic Studies (COMAS) gained authorization in 1986 to award a BA degree in business administration and accounting. COMAS became the first non-subsidized, non-profit academic institution in Israel to be recognized and certified by the country’s supreme educational authority, the Council for Higher Education in Israel. Official recognition of COMAS’ status marked the democratization of Israeli higher education. Today, COMAS is the largest college in Israel become a dynamic, innovative force in Israel’s higher educational framework.The Teaching Authority was established to improve the quality of teaching at institutions of higher education in Israel in general, and at COMAS in particular through various means, while developing tools to measure quality instruction. It encourages debate on the essence of academic teaching and its quality amongst the faculty and academic management.

The Research Authority aims to encourage research activity among the College schools and academic departments to aid faculty to locate research funds both in Israel and abroad and to prepare grant proposals. The Authority encourages faculty to engage in both basic and applied research as an important element for the improvement of the quality of teaching, a stepping-stone for the personal academic advancement of the faculty and the placing of the College on the academic map in Israel and abroad.

The Academic Studies has achieved its impressive growth because of its success in meeting a real need - the desire of young Israelis for a unique curricula that combines professional knowledge with practical application, close ties between faculty and students, and small classes.The College of Management central library lies in Rishon LeZion campus since 1995. In the year 2010, inaugurated in its building dedicated to the library structure.central library lies in Rishon LeZion campus since 1995.

 <h3>Student Management</h3>
 <img src="home6.jpg" align="left" width="150px" height="100px">
	 <p>A student information system (SIS), student management system, school administration software or student administration system is a management information system for education establishments to manage student data. Student information systems provide capabilities for registering students in courses, documenting grading, transcripts, results of student tests and other assessment scores, building student schedules, tracking student attendance, and managing many other student-related data needs in a school. A SIS should not be confused with a learning management system or virtual learning environment, where course materials, assignments and assessment tests can be published electronically.These systems vary in size, scope and capability, from packages that are implemented in relatively small organizations to cover student records alone, to enterprise-wide solutions that aim to cover most aspects of running large multi-campus organizations and their online schools with significant local responsibility. Many systems can be scaled to different levels of functionality by purchasing add-on "modules" and can typically be configured by their home institutions to meet local needs.

Since the millennium, and partly owing to "Y2K", which concerned birth dates and other data core to any ERP, the majority of SIS vendors took the opportunity to design into their products new features for not only classrooms and housing, but automating or simplifying processes in relation to a student's lifecycle. From application and Financial Aid, to career services and online education, some of the dominant SIS vendors may include in their products.Larger or more complex institutions typically require custom configuration or coding of the SIS, to fit their specific business processes, student services model or academic policies. Often, these customizations can involve scholarships, grants and other forms of Student financial aid. Where national or government systems exist for student finance or statistical return purposes, student information systems often provide functionality that caters to this, by way of built-in processes that are updated by SIS vendors to help meet regulatory and policy changes. Examples are the FAFSA (Free Application for Federal Student Aid) process in the United States, the United Kingdom's Student Loans Company processes (SSAR, SSAC and ATFEE file processing), the UCAS (Universities and Colleges Admissions Service) in the United Kingdom, or the HESA and HESES student statistical returns in the United Kingdom. In the United States, governmental bodies and accreditors have challenged some institutions to be increasingly accountable for a student's </p>

 <h3>Library Management</h3>
<img src="home7.jpg" align="left" width="150px" height="100px">
	 <p>Library management is a sub-discipline of institutional management that focuses on specific issues faced by libraries and library management professionals. Library management encompasses normal managerial tasks, as well as intellectual freedom and fundraising responsibilities. Issues faced in library management frequently overlap with those faced in managing non-profit organizations.[1]

The basic functions of library management include, but are not limited to: planning and negotiating the acquisition of materials, Interlibrary Loan (ILL) requests, stacks maintenance, overseeing fee collection, event planning, fundraising, and human resources.Most libraries that store physical media like books, periodicals, film, and other objects adhere to some derivative of the Dewey Decimal System as their method for tagging, storing, and retrieving materials based on unique identifiers.[3] The use of such systems have caused librarians to develop and leverage common constructs that act as tools for both library professionals and library users alike. These constructs include master catalogs, domain catalogs, indexes, unique identifiers, unique identifier tokens, and artifacts .

A master catalog acts as a catalog of all domain or topic-specific catalogs and often directs the user to a more specific area of a library, where the user can find a more specific domain catalog. For example, upon entering a very large library, one may find a master catalog that will direct a patron to a specific wing of the library that focuses on a specific subject, such as law, history, fiction, etc.

In contrast, domain catalogs are usually made up of a system of very large libraries, where a master catalog cannot hold all of the system's information. As a result, the master catalog leads the user to domain catalogs that contain homogeneous references to specific artifacts that fall within the category or domain assigned to that catalog. For example, a very large library may have many domain catalogs—one for law, one for history, one for fiction, etc. In the case of smaller libraries where the use of domain catalogs are unnecessary, the master catalog can contain all of the information.

Indexes represent a grouping of artifacts by some relevant grouping constraint. The most common index groupings are "by title," "by subject," and "by author."

Often referred to more simply as IDs, unique identifiers represent a means of assigning and tagging an artifact with a readable string of characters that is unique to that single artifact. Such identifiers usually include the address or location of the artifact within the library, and a unique character set that helps to distinguish artifacts that have common traits like common titles.</p>
